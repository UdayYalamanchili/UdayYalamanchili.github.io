          - Created a repository that stores course information like id, credits, capacity, days, time by using <mark>hash table</mark>.
          - User can insert new courses, search and update info like capacity of the course. 
          - Used open addressing with double hashing to resolve collisions and came up with a custom hash function to reduce the collisions.
