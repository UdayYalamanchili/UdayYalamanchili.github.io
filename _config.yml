          - Collaborated in a team of 4 to build a model leveraging unsupervised learning i.e., no human labeled training data and directly evaluated on a testing dataset.
          - Extracted noun groups by filtering out the 'CNN Daily mail' dataset. Used a T5 model pre-trained on the 'Common-Gen' dataset to construct sentences, leveraging the extracted noun groups.
          - Implemented a rules-based approach to create a synthetic dataset using the sentences and train a multiple-choice QA model. Evaluated it on Common Sense QA dataset (PyTorch). Achieved accuracy of 65% percent.

          - Built an image captioning model using Attention, a computer vision technique to produce richer and descriptive captions for a given image. Inputs were encoded using VGG 16.
          - Implemented Long Short-Term Memory architecture for decoder to generate a caption word by word and visualize, as the model shifts its gaze across various parts of the image while trying to generate the next word.
